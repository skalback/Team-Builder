# Team-Builder

## Description
This is a command line application run in Node that prompts the user for information about a team manager and then information about the team members. 
The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 
When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
